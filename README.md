[RealWork Sample](http://codeboyim.github.io/rws/)
===============

This sample project demonstrates a common input screen in the RealWork and how such a screen is developed recently using a more *modern* Web development approach.

Demo
----

Play it [**here**](http://codeboyim.github.io/rws/)


Features
----

Most of this sample is extracted from the source of the RealWork, but the UI and code have been simplified and slightly revised to emphasise more on the following technical features:

- Code separation and modular development
- Re-usable component
- Nested Backbone Views, Models and Collections
- Communications between components via Backbone.Event
- On-demand data loading

Tech
---

- [Backbone.js] - provides structures to be built on
- [RequireJS] - loads modules and components when required
- [jQuery] - fast and the most popular cross-browser DOM traversal/manipulation solution


Extras
----

There are few more things which are not used or applicable in the RealWork, but have been added here for the integrity of the project and in my very own interest.

- [Bower], a package managemer, to load the required tools and utilities
- [Grunt], the JavaScript task runner, and its powerful plug-ins to optimize and build the project
- [fontawesome], the replacement for the images used in the RealWork
- a new modal component and loader component
- Some CSS3 to improve the UI/UX
